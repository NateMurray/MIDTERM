      <h2>HEAR ME OUT!</h2>
      <img src="history.png" alt="My House">
  <p>Yes, the place has a history that sounds like a horror novel, but hear me out and then I'll explain why none of it proves a ghost. 
    Elias Thornwell built this house in the 1870s and kept a lab in the back wing he worked with dyes, preservatives, and chemicals that 
    would make a modern chemist raise an eyebrow. He was secretive because that was business then, not because he was summoning anything. 
    Those "strange lights" people remember? Late night burners and mercury lamps people didn't understand. The damp, metallic smell the neighbors 
    report after storms? Chemical residues leaching from buried waste and the foundations, not the scent of something supernatural.</p>

  <p>There was a fire in 1892 that sealed a staircase and, tragically, took lives. Official records call it an accident—and that is the simplest explanation. 
    But the house still keeps echoes: linens found folded oddly because mice nested and disturbed closets; lullabies that seem to come from nowhere because 
    sound carries weird in these old rooms. The journals you might read burnt at the edges are rambling notes on experiments and repairs, not spellbooks. 
    Builders who left saying tools vanished? I've seen the same: a lost wrench tucked under a floorboard or a bent nail from a botched renovation, not a thing 
    with intent. I check every practical cause first, because that is how you prove a place is ordinary.</p>

  <p>Still, I'll admit the house pushes at you. Renovations turn up trunks full of jars with cloudy contents and photographs with people cropped out of frames
     old margins carry inked rituals that were probably folk cures or theatrical nonsense. Those discoveries explain why tenants have left fear is a powerful thing,
      and stories feed on small, strange details. But fear is not proof. When someone says the house "wants" something, I go down to the cellar, examine the jars, 
      note the pattern, and show them the cracked bottles and the builder's ledger. I want you to feel the history, but I also want you to see the answers. If, 
      after evidence, you still feel watched bring a flashlight. I'll bring the receipts and a hammer.</p>
