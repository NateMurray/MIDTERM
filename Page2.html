  <p>Look, I get it this place looks like the kind of house people whisper about. But believe me when I say it isn't haunted. 
    I've lived here long enough to read every knock and creak, and almost every one of them has an ordinary explanation critters in the attic, 
    seasonal settling of the joists, an old radiator coughing at night. I'm not asking you to take my word for it listen closely and you'll hear the 
    patterns of an old house, not a performance.</p>

  <p>If someone points at a flicker or a draft, I walk them through the how and the why. Loose bulb? I change it. Bad weatherstripping? I replace it. 
    Strange smell? We find the forgotten box or the damp corner and fix it. I keep receipts, photos, and a toolbox handy precisely so I can show you the practical 
    fix instead of the dramatic story.</p>

  <p>If you still want a spooky tour, fine I'll give you the flashlight and the guided walk. But when we stop and look, the weirdness resolves into ordinary things
     an old book's perfume, a floorboard's complaint, a light socket that needs tightening. This house has stories; they make it interesting, not terrifying. 
     Convince yourself with evidence I'll help you find it.</p>
